# Finding_donors_Project
This is my first project in Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity
# Project Overview
In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I first explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next,I applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I evaluated several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, I optimized the model I had selected and presented it as a solution to CharityML. Finally, you I explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given
